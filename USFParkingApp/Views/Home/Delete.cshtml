<h2>Delete Parking Data</h2>

<p>This page would allow users (in a real system) to delete old or inactive lots.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lot 1A – Inactive for over 12 months</li>
    <li>Lot 9D – Permanently closed</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In a future version, you could click a “Delete” button next to each lot, and it would remove that record from the system after confirmation.
</p>
